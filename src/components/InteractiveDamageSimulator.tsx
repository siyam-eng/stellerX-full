                Each profession has different vulnerability levels based on their reliance on technology
                affected by solar weather. Astronauts face the highest risk due to direct exposure,
                while farmers have lower vulnerability through indirect GPS effects.

              <h4 className="font-bold text-white mb-2">Real-World Consequences</h4>
              <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                Solar storms can disrupt GPS navigation, damage satellites, cause power grid failures,
                and expose astronauts to radiation. Understanding these risks helps us prepare and
                protect critical infrastructure.
